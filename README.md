Two demo links (only available from 29 Sep 2018 to 3 Oct 2018):

* Demo on public chain: [public.secdevgame.site](https://public.secdevgame.site)
* Demo on public chain and consortium chain: [consortium.secdevgame.site](https://consortium.secdevgame.site)

In the two folders:

* The **contract** folder contains all the code used in our tutorial and live demo.
